	<p><br>The mission of the School of Business at Alabama A&M University is to provide quality management education
programs to a diverse student population at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The School utilizes effective
teaching, advising, applied scholarship, and community involvement to produce graduates who will become leaders,
managers, entrepreneurs, and productive employees in the private and public sectors.</br>
<br>Consistent with the University’s history and contemporary mission, the School concentrates on instruction while
seeking to combine the classic goal of intellectual development with the land-grant tradition of service. Applied and
interactive educational experiences are emphasized in both the graduate and undergraduate programs. While the
School of Business and the University are committed to graduate education, the School emphasizes undergraduate
education as its first responsibility. In addition to the coverage of basic business principles, all programs develop
students’ computer, communications, interpersonal relations, and leadership skills, thereby, preparing graduates for
success in local, state, national, and global business environments. The AAMU School of Business builds on its
historic mission of providing education for African-Americans to an expanded mission of educating a student body
that is diverse in terms of ethnicity, national origin, and socio-economic background.</br>
<br>Opportunities are provided for all students to gain leadership skills through involvement with student organizations
and to gain practical experiences through co-ops and internships in cooperation with business, government and nongovernment
organizations. A majority of the faculty members are of international origin holding degrees from the
U.S. Students are exposed to diversity and international perspectives. Faculty members are highly caring of their
students and 80% of the full-time faculty members have doctoral degrees. They are committed to excellence in
teaching and are engaged in scholarly activities. They are also active in institutional, professional and community
service.</br>
The School of Business, established September 1, 1968, will achieve its mission by meeting the following
objectives:</center>
<li>To promote intellectual development and traditional education of students</li>
<li>To guide students’ understanding of the environment in which businesses operate in the U.S. and around the
world as well as specific techniques and principles of the primary business disciplines
</li>
<li>To provide an in-depth study of a specific business discipline that includes how specialists in that field interact
with specialists from other disciplines to make decisions
</li>
<li>To offer students experiences in and out of the classroom that promote professionalism, ethical behavior, and
leadership skills</li>
<li>To provide the University community an opportunity to study various aspects of the business environment and
different business operations</li>
